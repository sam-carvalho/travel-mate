## Core Features

To be implemented:

### Interactive Chatbot "Mate"

Instead of boring forms, interact with our GPT-3-powered chatbot, "Mate". Whether you're a thrill-seeker looking for your next adrenaline rush or a relaxed traveler wanting to unwind, just tell Mate what you're looking for, and let it handle the rest.

### Real-time Weather Integration

Our application fetches real-time weather data for each of your potential travel destinations, ensuring that your travel plans align with current weather conditions. Don't let a surprise heatwave or unexpected showers ruin your vacation!

### Dynamic Itinerary Generation
Once Mate has gathered your preferences and factored in current weather data, it will provide a list of destination options. Upon selection, a detailed travel itinerary for each location will be generated, offering suggestions on activities, dining, and lodging.

### Dynamic Updates
Changed your mind or budget? With TravelMate, you're never locked in. Revisit your chat with Mate to adjust your preferences or click the "Refresh" button to get updated weather data. Your itinerary updates dynamically, offering new suggestions instantly.
